## General informations:

### What is C++?
- It is a compiled multi-paradigm programming language. It needs to be compiled before executing unlike python which is interpreted language.
- Multi-paradigm:
    * Procedural
    * OOP
    * Functional
    * Generic
    * Modular
- Standardized

### C++ versions, other related languages:
- CPP versions: 98, 03, 07, 11, 14 , 17, 20.

### What is program:
- A program is a sequence of instructions.

### Program structure:
- A cpp program has a header file ( for example ``` #include <iostream> ```) which basically imports some basic (or not so basic codes) to your program and makes your life easier.
- Function body is sequence of instructions separeted by symbol `` ; ``
- There are three types of instructions:
    - Declaration: `` type variable_name = value ``
    -  Expression: `` x = (2/3)*4 ``
    -  Control Structure: ``if(condition){statement ; } else{statement;} ``
    -  Iteration structure: ``for(iterator : range) , while(condition){statement ;}
    - Alphabet of the language
    - Main function : main() function is an entry point for a C++ program. We give the system access to our C++ code through the main() function. 
        ```
        int main(){
            statement ; 
            return 0 ;
            }
         
    
### Types of errors in C++:
   - Compilation error (`CE`):
        - Lexical error : [Read here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lexical-error/)
        
        - Syntax error : main() function is an entry point for a C++ program. We give the system                access to our C++ code through the main() function.
        ``` cout << " "<< (x, y) // semicolon missed ```
        
        - Semantic error : This error occurs when the statements written in the program are not                 meaningful to the compiler.
        ```   
        int a, b, c;
        a + b = c; //semantic error
        ```
        
  - Runtime errors (`RE`) : Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful      compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time error is division by zero      also known as Division error.
    ```div = n/0 ; ```

## Declarations & Definitions:
- Declaration: ``` type variable_name = value/literal ; ```
- Fundamental types:
  - *Numbers* :
     - int : 4 bytes: Stores integers from range [ -2<sup>31</sup> , 2<sup>31</sup> - 1] : ``int x = -2 ;``
     - unsigned : 4 bytes : Stores positive integers in the range [0, 2<sup>31</sup>-1] : ``insigned x = 2 ; ``
     - long long : 8 bytes :  Stores integers in range [ -2<sup>63</sup> , 2<sup>63</sup> - 1] : ```long long x = 10000000000ll ;```
     - unsigned long long : 8 bytes : Stores integers in range [0, 2<sup>63</sup> - 1] : ``` unsigned long long x = 10000000000ull ;```
  - float :  4 bytes : Stores approximate value of a real number.
  - double :  8 byes : Stores approx value of a number with double precision.
  - long double :  8 Bytes :  stores approximate value of a number with 4x precision.
  - bool : 1 byte : Stores a boolean value : true or false.
  - char : 1 byte : Stores a character from ASCII table.

- Identifiers : Any sequence of characters which donot start with a number and is not a keyword is an identifier.
    - ``` int x = 2;   ``` x is an identifier. 
- Literals : Special value for a variable (generally used to initialize a variable)
    - ```int x = 2; ``` 2 is a literal.
    
Variable definition, declaration point

- Implicit type conversions: Some types of variables can be used as other type.
    - ```bool x=0; ``` &rarr; conversion of int into bool (output : false)
    - ``` int x= 6.99999999; ``` &rarr; conversion of long into int (output : 6)
 
 
- Visibility scope and variable lifetime
    - Scope: Any variable can be accessed within a certain section of the code only. This is called         the scope of the variable. Types:
    
        * Block scope: 
            ``` 
            int main(){
                int x = 1;
                {   
                    int y = 2;
               } // y can't be accessed after this bracket.
            } 
            ```
                               
        * Function Argument scope:
        * Namespace scope:
        * Enumeration scope:
        * Class scope:
 
 
- Signed and usigned integer variables :
    All number types in C++ can either have a sign or not. For example, you can declare an int to only represent positive integers. Unless otherwise specified, all integer data types are signed data types, i.e. they have values which can be positive or negative. The unsigned keyword can be used to declare variables without signs.
    ```
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
       unsigned int i = -1;
       int x = i;
       cout << i << ", " << x;
       return 0;
    }
    ```
    Output: 
    ``` 4294967295, -1 ```
    
- Functions:
    - Declaration vs definition
        * Declaration: Declaration of a variable is for informing to the compiler the following                 information: name of the variable, type of value it holds and the initial value if any it             takes. i.e., declaration gives details about the properties of a variable.
            ``` 
            bool f (int n) ;
            ```
            - A variable or a function can be declared any number of times
            - Memory will not be allocated during declaration
        * Definition : Whereas, Definition of a variable says where the variable gets stored. i.e.,             memory for the variable is allocated during the definition of the variable.
            ``` 
            bool f (int n){
                  return n/2-1 ; 
                  }
             ```
             - A variable or a function can be defined only once
             - Memory will be allocated
             
    - One definition rule: A variable or a function can be declared any number of times but, it can         be defined only once.
    
    - Passing arguments and getting the result from functions
      ```
        int f( int n){
            int result = n%2 ;
            return result;
            }
       ```
   
    - Recursion :  Calling a function from within itself
           ``` 
            int factorial (int n){
                  return n<= 1 ? 1 : factorial(n-1)*n;
             }
           ```
        
    - `void` type : Void functions are known as Non-Value Returning functions. They are “void” due to       the fact that they are not supposed to return values.
         ``` 
            void f(){
                cout << "This is a void function" ;
                }
                    
    - `return` keyword : The void keyword, used in the previous examples, indicates that the function        should not return a value. If you want the function to return a value, you can use a data type        (such as int, string, etc.) instead of void, and use the return keyword inside the function:
       ```
        int myFunction(int x) {
          return 5 + x;
        }

        int main() {
          cout << myFunction(3);
          return 0;
        }

        // Outputs 8 (5 + 3)
        ```
        
- `const` qualifier: The qualifier const can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specify   that its value will not be changed ( Which depends upon where const variables are stored, we may     change the value of const variable by using pointer ).

    - Rule: everything that can be const __must__ be const
