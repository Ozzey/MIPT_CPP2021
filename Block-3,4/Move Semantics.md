# Move semantics:
+ Rvalues and lvalues in C++07 (recap), troubles with them (examples)
+ Temporary objects
+ General idea of the new value mechanism in C++11: solving troubles of C++07
+ Rvalue references
+ `std::move`, invalidation of the initilial objects after move
+ Move constructor, its signature and implementation
+ Move assignment operator, its signature and implementation
+ Default move constructor and move assignment operator
+ The rule of **three/five/zero**
+ Copy elision, RVO, NRVO
+ Complete and incomplete tyeps
+ Universal references
+ `std::remove_reference`
+ `std::move` implementation
+ `std::forward`, its implementation
+ Value categories in C++11: `glvalue`, `rvalue`, `lvalue`, `prvalue`, `xvalue`
+ Reference qualifiers
+ Noexcept specifiers in C++17, conditional noexcept specifiers in C++17, potentially throwing functions in C++17, noexcept operator in C++17
